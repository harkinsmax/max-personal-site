# Welcome!
This project is a simple website using React, Typescript, and React Router.

Since life is pretty busy for me, I don't have a ton of time to dedicate to building this site, so I plan to keep the scope small.

I plan to implement the following:

- A nice looking home page to welcome people to my website
- An "about me" page with some links and contact information so people can get in touch
- A blog-style page where I can put up pictures and stories about some of the fun things I've done in the last few years.

If I get some time later, it would be nice to come back and add:
 - [ ] Unit tests :smile:
 - [ ] A nicer 404 page
 - [ ] Ability to let people post comments on the blog
